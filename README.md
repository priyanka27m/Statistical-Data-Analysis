Statistical Data Analysis - Household Finance and Consumption of Italian Households

# SDA Project - Understanding Household Finance and Consumption of Italian Households

## About
This project explores household financial data to uncover patterns in income, spending, and assets using data analysis.

## Data Source
We use data from the European Household Finance and Consumption Survey (Banca d'Italia).

### Key Areas:
- **People**: Household size, employment, age groups.
- **Money**: Income sources, savings, investments, and debts.
- **Possessions**: Homes, vehicles, valuables.
- **Spending**: Food, utilities, rent, and general expenses.

## How We Work
1. **Cleaning Data**: Fixing errors, handling missing values, and detecting outliers.
2. **Seeing Patterns**: Charts, heatmaps, and comparisons.
3. **Testing Theories**: Checking statistical differences (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis).
4. **Building Models**: Predicting trends with regression, clustering, and decision trees.

## What We Found
- Men and women manage money differently.
- Household size impacts financial habits.
- Higher education often leads to more financial security.

## Tools We Use
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
